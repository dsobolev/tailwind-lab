I think that [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is an awesome tool.

Here I'm just playing around with it using [these helpful screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/tailwindlabs)

### Notes

#### Start the project
`npm run dev` - project is accessible by `http://localhost:3000`

#### Build assets & watch changes
`npx tailwindcss build -i css/sample.css -o build/main.css --watch`
